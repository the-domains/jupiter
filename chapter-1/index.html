<h1>Chapter 1</h1><p>Winter arrives in Detroit, and a madman is on the loose. </p><p>A
toxin has been released into the water supply which causes the infected body's
arsehole to begin ingesting the victim's legs. They are calling it "Dark
Star".</p><p>Jupiter can't shake the feeling that she has seen this toxin
at work before, and thinks that one of her old masters may be to blame. Jupiter
must try and put aside her differences and work with her estranged police
detective sister, Jamilla, to catch the killer before it is too late.</p><p>Their reunion was not an easy one.Standing on a roof top above the crime scene,
the smell of shit and ruined shoes hanging heavy in the air, Jupiter stares
down at the woman for whom she once had to check under the bed for
monsters.Despite being her older
sister, Jamilla always had an all-to-real sense of the monsters of this
world.And now, staring and the mangled
mess of corpses in front of her, she knew the monsters were no longer content
staying under her bed.</p><p>Feeling she was being watched, Jamilla started skyward to
see a silhouette framed in moonlight.She knew that half-fro anywhere, it was her sister.</p><p>She bolted for the rooftop, taking the stairs two at a time,
but when she arrived, and the putrid night air hit her again, she was
<a href="http://alone.As" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alone.As</a> she turned back, disappointed,
she noticed from the corner of her eye something swaying in the moonlight. </p><p>Attached to a tiny piece of thread was a
small wooden carving. </p><p>A crane. </p><p>A clue.</p><p>Jupiter knew more than anyone what wave of disaster was about to baptise
the streets below.</p><p>And there she stood, knowing there was only once person she
would dare approach with the knowledge her sister was still alive. Blind Mag, the Miss Havisham of lower 5th
street.</p><p>She would take the secret to her grave. As she had done at least 7 times that Jamilla
knew of. After all, she was a hard woman
to keep down.</p><p>If you were new to the neighborhood, you would presume Blind
Mag gained her extensive wealth from her empire of cheese shops, but everyone
knew that her wealth was tainted, dark. Like a skid-mark on a porcelain toilet
bowl, no amount of piss would wash away the twilight that crept into her soul.</p><p>Jamilla knew she had to try. This secret was colossal, and
left unanswered, would eat away at her
like the ravenous arseholes that now populated most of downtown Detroit. She
wasn't going alone though. Someone would have to help her deal with Blind Mag's
army of feral Chihuahuas. With faces like two grapes stuck to a walking lemon,
these beasts were more fruit than dog, which anyone who has ever been to
Delmonte knows, is much, much more dangerous.</p><p>She was exactly where Jamilla knew she would be. In the abandoned church of west 4th, Mag sat
in her fourth, or fifth wedding dress. Riddled with bullet holes and covered in, what Jamilla hoped, fererro
rocher stains, Mag rocked back and forth in the fetid gown.</p><p>She felt a tug on the leashes of her two citrus Cerberuses,
forgetting for a moment that two such ungodly creatures could never enter
hallowed ground, lest their insides turn into a bubbling yet refreshing
smoothie.</p><blockquote><p>Not looking a day over 69 </p></blockquote><p>Jamilla uttered as she drew
parallel with Mag.</p><blockquote><p>That’s what she said, </p></blockquote><p>Mag replied.</p><blockquote><p>And she was a cunt too.</p></blockquote><p>Mag always had a way with words, but this time there was
something off about them. Was she
speaking Russian? Jamilla didn’t
know. She didn’t speak Russian. But how did she understand her? Then she realised. Jupiter spoke Russian. Their bond was growing stronger. Almost as though Jupiter was in the room with
her.</p><p>Not quite. Peering
from outside the cracked dome roof Jupiter looked down on her sister and the
insane wedding bitch with a smile. You
couldn’t imagine a more desperate tableau. It was then Jupiter paused to question: </p><blockquote><p>How the fuck did I get up
here?And what is my obsession with
rooves.</p></blockquote><p>To answer that question, she would have to go back to her
early days, and to her imaginary friend Ruth Tyler, the Roof Tiler…</p><p>
