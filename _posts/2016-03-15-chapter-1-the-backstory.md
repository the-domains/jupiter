# Chapter 1 - The Backstory

Jupiter Jones sounds like a foxxy black detective from the
70's

Part time newspaper reporter for the detroit watchtower. Former side piece of Pappa Bontemps. She turned informant and is now wanted by half the crooks on
the street.

Suffering a brutal beating a the hands of Bontemps top men,
she escaped to asia where she trained with one of the most mystically gifted martial
arts masters.

Returning, seemingly from the dead, to wage war on the
rising tide of crime, the only person suspicious that Jupiter might have made a
supernatural return to the streets is her sister, Jamilla Jones, detective with
the Detroit PD.

Separated by divorce in their teens, they grew up on
opposite sides of the tracks, but Jamilla's love for her sister gave her an
almost psychic connection to her little sister

She knew, no matter what the news reports said, her sister
was alive.

After all, she hadn't felt her die.

Jupiter Jones, an expert wood whittler. It's something she picked up in Asia, and although it's
mostly practical, in that she makes mystic wooden darts, she's not opposed to
knocking up furniture for her downtown Detroit apartment (which is, of course,
above an old dry cleaners).

The owner of the Dry Cleaners is an old lady called Peggy
Graystash, and Jupiter strikes up a loving but unlikely friendship with her. As
Jupiter's Mother disappeared when she was very young, she comes to love Peggy
as the mother she never had. But Peggy has a secret past......

Peggy was once part of an elite team of female commandos,
smuggled in under the radar to gather intelligence in what would be the final
days of the Vietnam war. Owing to an
ambush, and a mole in the covert organisation into which she was drafter, they
were extracted under duress to a shadow site somewhere near panama. It was there, following years of torture she
met her guiding light. A guard who,
feeling sympathy for her cause, would leave her small wood carvings under her
pillow to remind her there was still beauty left in the world.He would take one away each day and bring her
a new one, fearing discovery.

His fears were confirmed one day when she reached under her
pillow to find not a wood carving, but the guard's severed finger, and a
smeared message...

> No hope

On one day, too many days later for her to have counted, she
was freed, and extracted back to a warehouse in the US under the same shadow of
secrecy with which she had been taken.

But she was not alone, for in her grew a a child of the
murdered guard.

A man whose name she
would never forget.

**Julius Bontemps.**
